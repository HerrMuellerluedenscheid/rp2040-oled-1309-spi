Embedded Rust OLED Example
==========================

This project was based off of the [Project template for rp2040-hal](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp2040-project-template). Check their README for setup.

The logic to drive the display via SPI has been ported from the [TIVA-C example](https://github.com/HerrMuellerluedenscheid/tm4c-oled-example).
